# Friday Night Funkin': SHITMOD EDITION

OKAY LISTEN UP, THIS IS JUST KADE ENGINE BUT WITH EVER SO SLIGHT TWEAKS TO DISCORD STATUS MESSAGES AND OTHER MINOR SHIT LIKE CHANGING SONG NAMES INTERNALLY SO I COULD HAVE PICO NAMED PERCY AND RENAME SPOOKEEZ TO POOPEEZ BECAUSE I HAVE THE HUMOUR OF A TEN YEAR OLD.

A MAJORITY OF THE CHANGES ARE ACTUALLY DONE THROUGH EDITING THE SONGS SO THEY HAVE FUNNY STUFF IN THEM AND ALSO RECHARTING THE STAGES SO THEY FIT THE NEW SHIT MUSIC.
ALSO VISUAL CHANGES LIKE THE DAD FROM WEEK 1 IS NOW THE "sToP PosTing AbouT amONG US!!!" GUY. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ALL THE CHANGES JUST DOWNLOAD AND BUILD THE PROJECT YOURSELF DAMN

OR WAIT FOR ME TO EVENTUALLY RELEASE THIS SOMEWHERE PUBLICLY IDK :SHRUG EMOTE:

THATS ALL OKAY BYE!!
